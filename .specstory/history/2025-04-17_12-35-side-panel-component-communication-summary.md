hey, create a comprhensive summary of events of compnnets in side panel and how they are being handled(communication chain)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a comprehensive summary of the events and component communication chain in the side panel. Let me analyze the code first.

The side panel is a complex component that manages several sub-components and handles various events. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Component Structure
1. **Main Component**: `EvalioAppWeb.SidePanel`
   - A LiveComponent that renders a fixed panel on the right side of the screen
   - Contains three main sections: Header, Calendar, and Containers for Reminders/Meetings

### Sub-Components
1. **CalendarComponent**
   - Displays calendar view
   - Receives `reminders` and `meetings` as props

2. **ReminderContainer**
   - Manages reminder cards
   - Receives:
     - `reminders`
     - `sorted_reminders`
     - `parent_pid` (reference to SidePanel)

3. **MeetingContainer**
   - Manages meeting cards
   - Receives:
     - `meetings`
     - `sorted_meetings`
     - `parent_pid` (reference to SidePanel)

4. **Form Components**
   - `ReminderFormComponent`
   - `MeetingFormComponent`
   - Both appear in modal popups

### Event Communication Chain

1. **Reminder Events**:
   ```
   ReminderCard -> ReminderContainer -> SidePanel
   ```
   - Events handled:
     - `show_reminder_form`: Opens form for new reminder
     - `hide_reminder_form`: Closes reminder form
     - `save_reminder`: Creates/updates reminder
     - `update_reminder_tag`: Updates reminder tag
     - `delete_reminder`: Removes reminder

2. **Meeting Events**:
   ```
   MeetingCard -> MeetingContainer -> SidePanel
   ```
   - Events handled:
     - `show_meeting_form`: Opens form for new meeting
     - `hide_meeting_form`: Closes meeting form
     - `save_meeting`: Creates/updates meeting
     - `update_meeting_tag`: Updates meeting tag
     - `delete_meeting`: Removes meeting

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Data Loading**:
   - SidePanel receives `reminders` and `meetings` as initial assigns
   - Data is sorted using `sort_reminders` and `sort_meetings`
   - Sorted data is passed to respective containers

2. **State Management**:
   - SidePanel maintains state for:
     - `reminders` and `sorted_reminders`
     - `meetings` and `sorted_meetings`
     - Form visibility states (`show_reminder_form`, `show_meeting_form`)
     - Editing states (`editing_reminder`, `editing_meeting`)

3. **Update Flow**:
   ```
   User Action -> Child Component -> SidePanel -> State Update -> Re-render
   ```
   - All updates flow through the SidePanel component
   - Changes trigger re-renders of affected components
   - Sorting is maintained after each update

### Modal Management
- Forms appear in modal popups with backdrop
- Controlled by `show_reminder_form` and `show_meeting_form` states
- Forms receive:
  - `myself` (parent reference)
  - `reminder` or `meeting` (for editing)

### Sorting Logic
- Reminders and meetings are sorted by date and time
- Sorting is maintained after each update operation
- Uses `sort_reminders` and `sort_meetings` helper functions

This architecture ensures a centralized state management through the SidePanel component while allowing child components to handle their specific responsibilities and communicate changes upward through events.
