# Understanding Expand Card Functionality (2025-04-19 00:39:57)

_**User**_

okay first explain to me how expand card is being handled

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll explain how the card expansion functionality is implemented across these files. Let me break it down step by step:

1. **State Management (in `mentees_live.ex`)**:
   - The LiveView maintains an `expanded_mentee_id` in its assigns, which tracks which mentee card is currently expanded
   - Initially, it's set to the ID of the first mentee if there are any mentees (`expanded_id = if length(mentees) > 0, do: to_string(hd(mentees).id), else: nil`)
   - The state is updated through the `handle_event("toggle_card", %{"id" => mentee_id}, socket)` callback
   - When a card is clicked, it toggles the expanded state: if the clicked card is already expanded, it collapses it (sets to `nil`), otherwise expands it

2. **Event Handling (in `mentees_live.ex`)**:
   - The `toggle_card` event is triggered when a card is clicked
   - The event handler receives the mentee's ID and updates the `expanded_mentee_id` in the socket assigns

3. **Card Component (in `mentee_card.ex`)**:
   - Each card receives an `expanded` prop which is a boolean indicating if it should be expanded
   - The card has a click handler: `phx-click="toggle_card" phx-value-id={@mentee.id}`
   - The expandable content is wrapped in a div with dynamic classes:
   ```elixir
   <div class={[
     "overflow-hidden transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out bg-gray-50",
     if(@expanded, do: "opacity-100 max-h-[500px] border-t", else: "opacity-0 max-h-0")
   ]}>
   ```
   - When expanded, it shows the content with a smooth animation (using CSS transitions)
   - When collapsed, it hides the content with `max-h-0` and `opacity-0`

4. **Container Component (in `mentee_container.ex`)**:
   - The container receives the `expanded_mentee_id` from the LiveView
   - It passes the expanded state to each card by comparing the mentee's ID with the `expanded_mentee_id`:
   ```elixir
   <MenteeCard.mentee_card
     mentee={mentee}
     expanded={@expanded_mentee_id == mentee.id}
   />
   ```

The flow works like this:
1. User clicks a card
2. The click event is sent to the LiveView with the card's ID
3. LiveView updates the `expanded_mentee_id` state
4. The state change triggers a re-render
5. The container passes the new expanded state to all cards
6. The clicked card's expanded content becomes visible with a smooth animation

This implementation ensures that only one card can be expanded at a time, and provides a smooth user experience with CSS transitions for the expansion/collapse animation.

_**User**_

instead of mantaining a list of expanded ids, create a attribute on struct of mentee, and set it false for every mentee after loading from database.
and then use that attribute for switching between expanded and normal card

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the code to use an `is_expanded` attribute in the Mentee struct instead of maintaining a separate list of expanded IDs. Here's how we'll do it:

1. First, let's modify the Mentee struct to include the new attribute:


---

```diff
    - attendance_percent: Percentage of attendance
    - assignment_percent: Percentage of assignments completed
+   - is_expanded: Boolean indicating if the mentee's card is expanded
    """
    require Logger
    defstruct [:id, :first_name, :last_name, :email, :pronouns, :profile_picture,
-              :cohort, :batch, :attendance_percent, :assignment_percent]
+              :cohort, :batch, :attendance_percent, :assignment_percent, :is_expanded]
  
    def new(attrs) do
```

```diff
        batch: batch,
        attendance_percent: attendance_percent,
-       assignment_percent: assignment_percent
+       assignment_percent: assignment_percent,
+       is_expanded: false
      }
    end
```

---

2. Now, let's update the LiveView to handle the expanded state differently:



---

```diff
    def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
      mentees = Mentee.list_mentees()
-     expanded_id = if length(mentees) > 0, do: to_string(hd(mentees).id), else: nil
+     # Set first mentee as expanded if there are any mentees
+     mentees = if length(mentees) > 0 do
+       [first_mentee | rest] = mentees
+       [%{first_mentee | is_expanded: true} | rest]
+     else
+       mentees
+     end
  
      {:ok, assign(socket,
        mentees: mentees,
        search_text: "",
-       sort_by: "name_asc",
-       expanded_mentee_id: expanded_id
+       sort_by: "name_asc"
      )}
    end
```

```diff
    @impl true
    def handle_event("toggle_card", %{"id" => mentee_id}, socket) do
-     expanded_id = if socket.assigns.expanded_mentee_id == mentee_id, do: nil, else: mentee_id
-     {:noreply, assign(socket, expanded_mentee_id: expanded_id)}
+     mentees = Enum.map(socket.assigns.mentees, fn mentee ->
+       if mentee.id == mentee_id do
+         %{mentee | is_expanded: !mentee.is_expanded}
+       else
+         %{mentee | is_expanded: false}
+       end
+     end)
+ 
+     {:noreply, assign(socket, mentees: mentees)}
    end
  
```

---

3. Finally, let's update the container and card components to use the new `is_expanded` attribute:




---

```diff
    attr :mentees, :list, required: true
    attr :class, :string, default: ""
-   attr :expanded_mentee_id, :string, default: nil
  
    def mentee_container(assigns) do
```

```diff
            <MenteeCard.mentee_card
              mentee={mentee}
-             expanded={@expanded_mentee_id == mentee.id}
+             expanded={mentee.is_expanded}
            />
          </div>
```

---

These changes accomplish the following:

1. Added `is_expanded` to the Mentee struct with a default value of `false`
2. Modified the LiveView to:
   - Set the first mentee as expanded when loading the page
   - Update the `toggle_card` event handler to toggle the `is_expanded` state of the clicked mentee and set all others to `false`
3. Updated the container component to use the `is_expanded` attribute directly from the mentee struct

The main benefits of this approach are:
- The expanded state is now part of the mentee data structure itself
- We don't need to maintain a separate list of expanded IDs
- The code is more maintainable as the state is encapsulated within the mentee struct
- The logic for handling expanded state is more straightforward

The functionality remains the same - only one card can be expanded at a time, and clicking a card will toggle its expanded state while collapsing all others.

_**User**_

i am geting this error

---

_**Assistant**_

I don't see an actual error message in what you've shared. What I see is a Mentee struct with some data, which looks correct with the new `is_expanded` field set to `false`. 

Could you please share the actual error message you're getting? This will help me better understand what's going wrong and how to fix it. The error could be related to:

1. The database query not handling the new field
2. The LiveView not properly handling the state updates
3. The components not properly receiving the updated data

Please share the error message and I'll help you resolve it.

---

_**User**_

here's the error

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue now. The error is `KeyError: key :expanded_mentee_id not found` which means we're still trying to access `expanded_mentee_id` somewhere in the code even though we've removed it from the assigns.

Let me check the LiveView template to see where this reference might still exist:



---

Read file: app/lib/evalio_app_web/components/mentees/mentees_live.ex

---

I found the issue! There are two places where we're still referencing `expanded_mentee_id`:

1. In the `render` function, we have a debug `IO.inspect` that's still looking for `expanded_mentee_id`
2. In the template, we're still passing `expanded_mentee_id` to the `MenteeContainer` component

Let's fix both of these:




---

```diff
    @impl true
    def render(assigns) do
-     IO.inspect({"Render called", expanded_mentee_id: assigns.expanded_mentee_id}, label: "DEBUG")
      ~H"""
      <div class="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
```

```diff
            <MenteeContainer.mentee_container
              mentees={@mentees}
-             expanded_mentee_id={@expanded_mentee_id}
            />
          </div>
```

---

I've made two changes:
1. Removed the debug `IO.inspect` that was looking for `expanded_mentee_id`
2. Removed the `expanded_mentee_id` prop being passed to the `MenteeContainer` component

These changes should resolve the error you're seeing. The code will now properly use the `is_expanded` attribute from the Mentee struct instead of trying to access the non-existent `expanded_mentee_id` in the assigns.

Try refreshing your page and the error should be gone. Let me know if you see any other issues!

---

_**User**_

it's still not working

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the `handle_info` function for the search functionality, as it might be resetting the `is_expanded` state when searching. When we search, we're getting new mentees from the database but not preserving the expanded state:




---

```diff
    @impl true
    def handle_info({:search_mentees, search_text}, socket) do
+     # Get the currently expanded mentee ID if any
+     currently_expanded_id = Enum.find_value(socket.assigns.mentees, fn mentee ->
+       if mentee.is_expanded, do: mentee.id
+     end)
+ 
+     # Get new mentees from search
      mentees = if search_text == "" do
        Mentee.list_mentees()
      else
        Mentee.search_mentees(search_text)
      end
+ 
+     # Preserve the expanded state
+     mentees = Enum.map(mentees, fn mentee ->
+       if mentee.id == currently_expanded_id do
+         %{mentee | is_expanded: true}
+       else
+         mentee
+       end
+     end)
  
      {:noreply, assign(socket, search_text: search_text, mentees: mentees)}
```

---

I've updated the `handle_info` function for search to:
1. Find the ID of the currently expanded mentee (if any)
2. Get the new mentees from the search
3. Preserve the expanded state by setting `is_expanded: true` for the mentee that was previously expanded

This should fix the issue where the expanded state was being lost during searches. The expanded state will now persist when:
- Initially loading the page
- Toggling cards
- Searching for mentees

Let me know if you're still seeing any issues!

_**User**_

give me the event chain of what happens when card is clicked

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me break down the event chain when a card is clicked:

1. **Initial Click Event**:
   - User clicks on a mentee card
   - The click triggers the `phx-click="toggle_card"` event in `mentee_card.ex` with the mentee's ID
   ```elixir
   <div
     class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-all duration-300 cursor-pointer"
     phx-click="toggle_card"
     phx-value-id={@mentee.id}
   >
   ```

2. **Event Handling in LiveView**:
   - The `handle_event("toggle_card", %{"id" => mentee_id}, socket)` callback in `mentees_live.ex` is triggered
   - It maps over all mentees and:
     - Sets `is_expanded: true` for the clicked mentee
     - Sets `is_expanded: false` for all other mentees
   ```elixir
   mentees = Enum.map(socket.assigns.mentees, fn mentee ->
     if mentee.id == mentee_id do
       %{mentee | is_expanded: true}
     else
       %{mentee | is_expanded: false}
     end
   end)
   ```

3. **State Update**:
   - The LiveView updates its state with the new mentees list
   ```elixir
   {:noreply, assign(socket, mentees: mentees)}
   ```

4. **Re-render**:
   - The LiveView re-renders with the new state
   - The `mentee_container` component receives the updated mentees list
   - Each `mentee_card` receives its updated `expanded` prop based on `mentee.is_expanded`

5. **UI Update**:
   - The card's expanded content becomes visible/hidden based on the `expanded` prop
   - The transition is animated through CSS classes:
   ```elixir
   <div class={[
     "overflow-hidden transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out bg-gray-50",
     if(@expanded, do: "opacity-100 max-h-[500px] border-t", else: "opacity-0 max-h-0")
   ]}>
   ```

The key points in this chain are:
- Only one card can be expanded at a time (all others are set to `false`)
- The state is maintained in the mentee struct itself
- The UI updates are handled through Phoenix LiveView's reactive updates
- The transition is smooth due to CSS animations

This creates a smooth user experience where:
1. Click a card
2. That card expands
3. Any previously expanded card collapses
4. The transition is animated

_**User**_

okay so scratch all the event handling for toggle form and expanded,
just make the card conditonal in mentee_card i.e. normal card if expanded is false and expanded card when it is true

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you simplify the card component to have two distinct states based on the `expanded` prop. Let's modify the `mentee_card.ex` file:




---

```diff
    def mentee_card(assigns) do

      """
```

I've made the following changes to the `mentee_card.ex`:

1. Removed the click event handlers (`phx-click` and `phx-value-id`)
2. Created two distinct card states using an `if @expanded` condition:
   - **Expanded State** (`@expanded == true`):
     - Larger profile picture (16x16)
     - Shows full name with pronouns
     - Shows email
     - Shows attendance and assignment progress circles with actual percentages
     - Has a gray background section for stats
   
   - **Collapsed State** (`@expanded == false`):
     - Smaller profile picture (12x12)
     - Shows just name and cohort-batch
     - More compact layout

3. Fixed the progress circles to use actual percentages from the mentee data:
   - `@mentee.attendance_percent` for attendance
   - `@mentee.assignment_percent` for assignments

The card now simply renders one of two states based on the `expanded` prop, without any animation or transition logic. The state management is handled entirely by the parent components.

Let me know if you'd like to make any adjustments to either the expanded or collapsed state!

now remove all the functionality regarding toggle and click in notes live

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you remove all the toggle and click-related functionality from `mentees_live.ex`. This includes removing the event handler and any related state management:

I've made the following changes to `mentees_live.ex`:

1. Removed the `handle_event("toggle_card", ...)` function that was handling card clicks
2. Removed the expanded state preservation logic from the search handler
3. Simplified the search handler to just update the mentees list without any expanded state management

The LiveView now:
- Only sets the first mentee as expanded on initial load
- Doesn't handle any card click events
- Doesn't preserve expanded state during searches
- Simply passes the mentees list to the container component

This makes the code much simpler and removes all the interactive card functionality. The cards will now just display in their current state (expanded or collapsed) based on the `is_expanded` attribute in the mentee struct.
